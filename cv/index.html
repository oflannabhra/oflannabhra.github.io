    <h4> Big Ass Fans
      <p>
        iOS Developer and Firmware Developer <span class="date">(current-2015)</span>
      </p>
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Role Overview</strong> - At Big Ass Fans, my responsibilities have shifted with the demands of the business. I was hired as an iOS developer working in Objective-C within the Controls group, but my responsibilities quickly came to include representing the company in the Thread Group, helping to define new hardware projects, leading a team as Product Owner, developing firmware in C/C++, and developing new applications in Swift.</li>
      <div class="page-break"></div>
      <li><strong>Notable projects</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/haiku-by-baf/id902021647">Haiku by BAF</a> - I worked with another developer to add new features to this iOS application which controls all of BAF&#8217;s residential products: fans, lights, wall controls. Features included: grouping, smart thermostat integration, and Apple HomeKit.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.threadgroup.org">Thread Group</a> - I represented the interests of the company as the vice-chair of the Commercial Working Group, which was responsible for generating the 1.2 Thread Networking Specification&#8217;s Commercial Extensions. Specifically, I helped write a proposal to support IP-based, secure commissioning and decommissionsing of Thread devices. Later, I represented BAF on the Thread Group Board of Directors.</li>
          <li><strong>BASNet</strong> - This was a suite of 5 hardware devices that would allow BAF to do wireless retrofits in the commercial space. The devices consisted of fans, lights, and wall switches that communicated over a Thread mesh network. I helped define the feature set, design the communications API, and build the iOS application.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.bigassfans.com/docs/bafcon/cutsheet-bafcon.pdf">BAFCon</a> - BAFCon is a touchscreen controller for BAF&#8217;s industrial fans. I helped define the product features, and was one of the primary developers on a team of four. I was responsible for selecting a UI framework, implementing major features in our embedded stack, architecting our device model, and defining a Bluetooth API to support OTA firmware updates. This product was so well-liked by management that is was fast-tracked and attached to all sales of BAF&#8217;s premium products.</li>
          <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bafcon-updates/id1403542146">BAFCon Updates</a> - This is the iOS application responsible for updating BAFCon firmware over Bluetooth. I was the sole developer, and completed the project in 2 months. It supports downloading firmware from our servers, connecting over Bluetooth to BAFCons, and updating their firmware. It can support multiple, independent connections and updates, while giving the user valuable feedback during the process.</li>
          <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i6-by-baf/id1472272574">i6 by BAF</a> - BAF launched a new residential fan, and I worked with another developer to almost completely refactor the Haiku by BAF codebase. This effort is essentially a new platform for all next generation BAF residential products. I was responsible for updating our CoreData model, implementing our protobuf API, handling all startup tasks, implementing our account login, and the entire device on-boarding process over Bluetooth, amongst others.</li>
          <li><strong>Jenkins CI/CD build pipleine</strong> - Before I was at BAF, all iOS builds were done on developer computers. I built an automated pipeline on our shared Jenkins infrastructure to build all Pull Requests in Github, run all unit tests, report any builld or test failures to Slack and Github, upload build artifacts for successful, tagged builds to App Store Connect, release new builds to TestFlight, upload de-symbolication files to Fabric for crash-reporting
