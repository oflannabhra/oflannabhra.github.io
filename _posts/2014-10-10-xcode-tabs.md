I was getting pretty frustrated with Xcode 6 the other day. Specifically, I was getting irritated by constantly having to fiddle with my layout continually getting adjusted. 

## The Problem

Like many IDEs, Xcode's layout is divided into panes.

* Navigator (left side pane)
* Editor (center)
* Utilities (right side pane)
* Debug/Console (bottom pane)

Each of these have quite a few different contextual modes

### Navigator Pane
 * Project Navigator (`⌘ 1`)
 * Symbol Navigator (`⌘ 2`) 
 * Find Navigator (`⌘ 3`)
 * Issue Navigator (`⌘ 4`)
 * Test Navigator (`⌘ 5`)
 * Debug Navigator (`⌘ 6`)
 * Breakpoint Navigator (`⌘ 7`)
 * Report Navigator (`⌘ 8`)

![The Utility / Inspector Pane selection menu]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/utility.png)

### Utility Pane
 * File Inspector (`Opt ⌘ 1`)
 * Quick Help Inspector (`Opt ⌘ 2`)
 * Identity Inspector (`Opt ⌘ 3`)
 * Attributes Inspector (`Opt ⌘ 4`)
 * Size Inspector (`Opt ⌘ 5`)
 * Connections Inspector (`Opt ⌘ 6`)

![The Editor Pane selection menu]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/editor.png)

### Editor
 * Standard Editor (`⌘ Ret`)
 * Assistant Editor (`Opt ⌘ Ret`)
 * Version Editor (`Opt Shft ⌘ Ret`)
